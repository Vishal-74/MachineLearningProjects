# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed by [Your Name].

## Projects:

### 1. Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter

- **Description:** A simple Python program to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- **File:** `celsius_to_fahrenheit.py`
- **Usage:** Run the script and input the temperature in Celsius to get the converted temperature in Fahrenheit.

### 2. Diabetes Prediction

- **Description:** A machine learning project predicting diabetes using classification algorithms.
- **Files:** 
  - `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, data preprocessing, and model building.
  - `diabetes_data.csv`: Dataset used for prediction.

### 3. Heart Disease Prediction

- **Description:** Machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Files:** 
  - `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
  - `heart_disease_data.csv`: Dataset used for heart disease prediction.
